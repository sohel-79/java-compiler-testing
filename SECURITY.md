# Security Policy

This library is primarily designed for use in test packs, rather than as a
deployed unit that runs on some production system. Regardless, I know
from experience that security vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies
can be a nightmare for handling security compliance in a business when
patches are not readily available. Therefore, I will ensure my upmost to
keep dependencies up to date should vulnerabilities be discovered in them.
Likewise, I will try to address any issues in this project itself as soon
as I am aware of them.

## Supported Versions

Right now, this project is under active development, so security support
will be dealt with on an as-needed basis. Feel free to contact me in an
issue or discussion to talk about this.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities can be reported using the issue tracker for now. I may set
up another means of reporting this in the future if a need arises.
